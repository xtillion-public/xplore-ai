# From Big Data to Modern Analytics

## UPRM Big Data Presentation

"_From Big Data to Modern Analytics_" was a workshop offered by Xtillion at the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM) as part of the undergraduate computer science and engineering course **CIIC 5140: Big Data Analytics** during the Fall 2025 semester.

As part of the presentation, three live demos were presented:

1. AI Powered Analytics with Snowflake
2. Apache Iceberg in Databricks
3. Scalable Unstructured Data Processing with Ray

## Demos

In each folder you can find the Python Jupyter notebooks used and presented during the live demos, along with any extra data or resources if needed.

### Prerequistes

* For the first and second demos, you need access to _Snowflake_ and _Databricks_, respectively.
* For the third demo, you can run it locally on your machine as long as you can:
  * Run Jupyter Notebooks
  * Install the Python dependencies (`ray`, `pdfplumber`, and `matplotlib`)

## Data Sources

Any of the data sources referenced throughout the demos can be found here in this repo, or at the public Amazon S3 bucket `s3://uprm-2025-demo-yelp`.
